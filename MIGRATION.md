# Migration

## Migrate from 4.x.x to 5.x.x

Upgrade the package version with Yarn:

```shell
yarn upgrade v-phone-input@^5.0.0
```

From version `5.0.0`, `v-phone-input` is using awesome-phonenumber v7.

If you are using exposed data from the component, you must ensure these are
still available, because exposed variables have been strictly defined.
You can check available exposed data on
[the exposed properties documentation](README.md#exposed).

## Migrate from 3.x.x to 4.x.x

If you are coming from `2.x.x`, you should also follow
the ["Migrate from 2.x.x to 3.x.x" guide](#migrate-from-2xx-to-3xx).

Upgrade the package version with Yarn:

```shell
yarn upgrade v-phone-input@^4.0.0
```

From version `4.0.0`, `v-phone-input` is using awesome-phonenumber v6.
All functions and types have been updated to use awesome-phonenumber's
`ParsedPhoneNumber` type, instead of a library internal type. As a consequence:

- `PhoneNumberObject` and `ExtendedPhoneNumber` types have been removed, and
  a awesome-phonenumber's `ParsedPhoneNumber` object is used instead.
  `ParsedPhoneNumber` does not provide methods anymore (such as `isValid()`),
  you should now use the properties instead (such as `valid`).
- `makePhone` will now return a `ParsedPhoneNumber` object.
- `makeExample` will now return a `ParsedPhoneNumber` object.
- `formatPhone` will now take a `ParsedPhoneNumber` object as its first argument.

## Migrate from 2.x.x to 3.x.x

If you are coming from `1.x.x`, you should also follow
the ["Migrate from 1.x.x to 2.x.x" guide](#migrate-from-1xx-to-2xx).

> From version `3.0.0`, `v-phone-input` is using Vuetify 3 and Vue 3 and is only compatible with
> those. As a consequence, some undocumented props or events inherited from Vuetify or Vue have
> changed (e.g. `value` is now `modelValue`, `filled` is now `variant="filled"`
> or `@input` is now `@update:modelValue`). The input style has also changed a lot to follow
> the new Vuetify classes' names.

Upgrade the package version with Yarn:

```shell
yarn upgrade v-phone-input@^3.0.0
```

You might also update your code if you are using the following features which changed:

- Configuration option and prop `preferredCountries` renamed to `preferCountries`.
- Configuration option and prop `onlyCountries` renamed to `includeCountries`.
- Configuration option and prop `ignoredCountries` renamed to `excludeCountries`.
- Configuration option and prop `disableGuessingCountries` changed to `guessCountry`. This new
  property does the inverse of the previous one and defaults to `false`, because IP2C service is
  regularly throwing timeouts.
- `PhoneUtils` class has been decomposed into independent functions (`makePhone`, `makeExample`
  and `formatPhone`) to provide better ESM tree shaking.
- Exported component `VPhoneCountrySprite` renamed to `VCountryIconSprite` with changed
  behavior (`role="img"` with `title` instead of `d-sr-only` span).
- Exported component `VPhoneCountrySvg` renamed to `VCountryIconSvg` with changed
  behavior (`role="img"` with `title` instead of `d-sr-only` span).
- Changed `awesome-phonenumber` dependency from `^2.69.0` to `^3.0.0`.
- Changed `vue` peer dependency from `^2.6.14` to `^3.0.0`.
- Changed `vuetify` peer dependency from `^2.6.4` to `^3.0.0`.

## Migrate from 1.x.x to 2.x.x

Upgrade the package version with Yarn:

```shell
yarn upgrade v-phone-input@^2.0.0
```

If you are using the plugin the global plugin registration method, you need to update the file where
you are defining it:

```diff
  import Vue from 'vue';
- import VPhoneInputPlugin from 'v-phone-input';
+ import { createVPhoneInput } from 'v-phone-input';
+ import 'v-phone-input/dist/v-phone-input.css';
  import 'flag-icons/css/flag-icons.min.css';

- Vue.use(VPhoneInputPlugin, { countryIconMode: 'svg' });
+ const vPhoneInput = createVPhoneInput({ countryIconMode: 'svg' });
+ Vue.use(vPhoneInput);
```

> CSS have been extracted to a file, so you'll also need to
> import `v-phone-input/dist/v-phone-input.css` (even if you are using the per-file registration),
> like in the example above.
